I am a second year MSc artificial intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. These days I am focused on figuring out how an AI can robustly infer what humans want from what they do. My CV can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrgyABLuj5B2oup__32KymF0xt72iEVD/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, listening to podcasts and meditating.
