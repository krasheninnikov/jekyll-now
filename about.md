I have just graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a masters in artificial intelligence, and am now figuring out my next steps. During the masters I had a chance to work with the Center for Human-Compatible AI at UC Berkeley, which resulted in two papers.


<!---I am a second year MSc artificial intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. These days I am focused on figuring out how an AI can robustly infer what humans want from what they do. --->

<!--- In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, listening to podcasts and meditating.  --->
