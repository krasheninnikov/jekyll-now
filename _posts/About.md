I am a senior CS student at the South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences. I care about minimizing technological risks to humanity and intend to work in the field of AI Safety. These days I am focused on deep learning, reinforcement learning and game theory. I accepted a research internship at UC Berkeley's Center For Human-Compatible AI for the upcoming summer.
